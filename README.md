# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project üìä, where we explore the dynamic job data space with a focus on highly sought-after data analyst roles. This is my journey toward uncovering top-paying jobs üíº, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets great opportunities in data analytics.

Check out my SQL queries here: [Project_sql folder](/Project_sql/)

# Background
The inspiration for this project came from the need for me to learn more about the job market for a data analyst. My goal was to find out what skills are most lucrative and demanded, and thus have my job search more focused and efficient.

The questions that I wished to respond to via my SQL queries were:

- What are the highest-paying jobs for data analysts

- What are the skills needed for these high-paying jobs?

- What are the most demanded skills for data analysts?

- What skills command higher pay rates?

- What are the best skills to acquire for a data analyst who wants to have the maximum job market value?
# Tools I used
In this project, various analysis techniques were employed using the following tools:

* **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Allowed me to communicate with the database, retrieve insights, and respond to my most important questions using queries.
* **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL enabled me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting information.
* **Visual Studio Code:** The free, open-source admin and development platform assisted me with managing the database and running SQL commands.

# The Analysis
Each of the query of this project was aimed to investigate specific aspects of the job market for data analyst.

Here's how I approached with each of the questions:

Despite being a standard requirement, its average salary remains competitive at around $97K, reflecting its ongoing importance.

üîπ **Excel and PowerPoint maintain their value:** Often considered basic, tools like Excel (256 postings) and PowerPoint (58 postings) are still heavily used for day-to-day analysis, dashboards, and stakeholder presentations. Their inclusion in job requirements shows that employers still prioritize communication and spreadsheet proficiency, particularly in business-oriented roles.

üîπ **Python and R drive higher salaries:** While Python (236 postings) and R (148 postings) appear less frequently than SQL or Excel, their average salaries exceed $100K. This suggests that data analysts who can code ‚Äî for automation, data wrangling, or modeling ‚Äî are positioned for higher-paying roles, especially in more technical or data science-adjacent positions.

üîπ **Visualization and BI tools are essential and rewarding:** Tools like Tableau (230 postings), Power BI (110 postings), and Looker (49 postings) show a clear trend: the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through visual storytelling is crucial. Notably, Looker stands out with the highest average salary on the list ($103K+), indicating a premium for modern BI platforms that integrate well with cloud data environments.

üîπ **SAS still holds niche relevance:** Though not as widely required (63 postings), SAS continues to command nearly $99K in average salary, particularly in sectors like healthcare, banking, or government where it's still deeply embedded.
